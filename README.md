## Project: epicGraphics
**Names and Periods: Caleb Kahan (PD 4) + Eric Shau (PD ?)**</br></br>
**List of Features we want to implement:**  
  * New MDL Polygon Functions
    * Creating 2D polygons with an arbitrary number of edges defined by the user
    * Creating complex 2D shapes using bounding by functions
    * Creating complex 2D shapes by intersecting two complex 2D shapes or unionizing. 
    * Define the plane as the xy plane, xz plane, or yz plane
  * Extrusion Command
    * Create a 3D solid by extruding a given polygon into either the positive or negative direction of the perpindicular axis
  * Revolution Command
    * Create a 3D solid by rotating a given polygon around an gien axis
  * Truncation Command
    * Modify a 3D solid by bounding the object between axises. (EX: hemisphere)
  * Volume Command
    * Find Volume of 3D solid
  * Combination Commands
    * Create a New 3D solid from the combination of two 3D solids
  * Change the behavior of vary
    * add a parameter to change how it calculates the change over time. e.g. Linear, Exponential, Logarithmic, Arbitrary equation, etc.
