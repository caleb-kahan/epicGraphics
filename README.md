## Project: epicGraphics
**Names and Periods: Caleb Kahan (PD 4) + Eric Shau (PD ?)**</br></br>
**Features we want to implement:**  
  * New MDL Polygon Functions
    * Creating 2D polygons with an arbitrary number of edges defined by the user
    * Creating complex 2D shapes using functions
    * Define the plane as the xy plane, xz plane, or yz plane
  * Extrusion Command
    * Create a 3D solid by extruding a given polygon into either the positive or negative direction of the perpindicular axis
  * Reolution Command
    * Create a 3D solid by rotating a given polygon around an gien axis
   *
